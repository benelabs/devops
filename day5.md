# DevOps: Day 5

- Started by learning how to connect to a virtual machine on AWS using ssh from one's local computer.
- Also installed the aws cli binary on my system and learnt how to make use of it. And also learnt about the documentation where one can always lookup things they want to do with the aws command.
- Also, learnt about using AWS Api, although to use this api, one will need to make use of a programming language, and I learnt of a popular package written in python called boto which one can easily make use of to both make request and receive response.
