# DevOps: Day 11

- Shell script of github integration.

- We can talk to an application through the cli or api. 
- API is Application Interface. 
- We can talk to a program programmatically if that program expose expose their application interface.
- DevOps Engineers Don't write the APIs, but they make use of the APIs.
- You can either use curl or postman with https to make calls to this API(s).
- For aws, one can either make use of the cli called aws cli or you go with the api and make use of Python boto.
- Sometimes with github, anything that can't be done using the GUI cannot also be done using the cli.
