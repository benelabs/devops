# DevOps: Day 23

* GitHub Actions

- GitHub Actions is another CI/CD solutions, it also works like Jenkins, but only focused on GitHub platform.
- GitHub Actions/GitLab CI are platform oriented solutions.
- Advantages of GitHub Actions over Jenkins
Hosting: Jenkins is self-hosted, meaning it requires its own server to run, while GitHub Actions is hosted by GitHub and runs directly in your GitHub repository.

User interface: Jenkins has a complex and sophisticated user interface, while GitHub Actions has a more streamlined and user-friendly interface that is better suited for simple to moderate automation tasks.

Cost: Jenkins can be expensive to run and maintain, especially for organizations with large and complex automation needs. GitHub Actions, on the other hand, is free for open-source projects and has a tiered pricing model for private repositories, making it more accessible to smaller organizations and individual developers.
